# GoQueue.GG Application GUI
This repository contains the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the official GoQueue.GG application. The interface is built using PicoCSS to provide a clean and responsive user experience.

## Project Structure
The GoQueue.GG application consists of two main components:

### Frontend
Description: The GUI, developed using HTML and styled with PicoCSS, is responsible for rendering the user interface.

Location: This repository contains the complete source code for the frontend.
### Backend
Description: The backend leverages the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) with JavaScript bindings (referenced in the code as app.) to handle server connections and other application logic.

Integration: The backend communicates seamlessly with the frontend to deliver a cohesive user experience.
